## Project Context

Imagine you are part of the American Library Association. Over the past two years, there have been 5,894 books banned in K-12 schools across the United States. This project aims to highlight the importance of these bans and why they matter.

### Why Should You Care if a Book Gets Banned?

Books provide:
- **Access to Diversity in Education**
- **Encouragement of Critical Thinking through Exposure**
- **Promotion of Equal Access**
- **Safeguarding of Freedom of Expression**
- **Development of Cultural Understanding**

## Data Description

The data for this project is sourced from PEN America's Index of School Book Bans. It includes:
- **Title**
- **Author**
- **School District**
- **State**

The data covers the period from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023, and highlights restrictions on student access to books in US school libraries or classrooms. Some bans have been lifted, while others are ongoing.

## Themes in Banned Books

The banned books often cover themes such as:
- **Identity**
- **Coming-of-Age**
- **Social Issues**
- **Acceptance and Belonging**
- **Friendship and Relationships**

## Project Outcome

The primary outcome of this project was to create a polished graphic that effectively tells a story about book bans in the United States. Our goal was to visually communicate the data and its implications in a compelling and accessible manner.

Explore our interactive graphic on [Plotly](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~aholland/1/#/) to visualize the data on book bans.

## Proposal for Action

We propose that the American Library Association creates a program allowing youth under the age of 21 access to digital libraries, regardless of their geographic location. This would help mitigate the impact of book bans and ensure equal access to diverse educational resources.
