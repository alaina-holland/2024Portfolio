## Project Context

Imagine you are part of the American Library Association. Over the past two years, there have been 5,894 books banned in K-12 schools across the United States. This project aims to highlight the importance of these bans and why they matter.

### Why Should You Care if a Book Gets Banned?

Books provide:
- **Access to Diversity in Education**
- **Encouragement of Critical Thinking through Exposure**
- **Promotion of Equal Access**
- **Safeguarding of Freedom of Expression**
- **Development of Cultural Understanding**


In the 2022-2023 academic year, Texas and Florida led in the number of book bans, with Texas banning at least 500 books and Florida banning over 750 books.

- **Social Issues**
