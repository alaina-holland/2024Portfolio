# Impacts of Sedimentation and Temperature on Coral Survival

## Project Overview
This project examines the resilience of corals, specifically the mustard hill coral (*Porites astreoides*), against two major environmental threats: sedimentation and temperature increase. The study aims to determine whether reducing anthropogenic sedimentation can help corals endure climate change. Two experimental setups were used to observe the survival rates of coral recruits under varying levels of sedimentation and temperature.

## Data Source
- **Experimental Study**: The data was collected from coral recruits exposed to different conditions of temperature (26°C and 30°C) and sedimentation (30-120 mg/cm²) using both natural and anthropogenic sediments.

## Project Context
Coral reefs are vital to ocean ecosystems and coastal economies. However, they are under threat due to increasing global temperatures and human activities like dredging, which creates turbid water conditions and sedimentation that blocks sunlight and suffocates corals. This study investigates how these factors affect coral survival and whether reducing human-caused sedimentation can help corals withstand rising temperatures.

## Why Should You Care About Coral Survival?
Coral reefs provide numerous benefits:
- **Ecosystem Support**: They are home to thousands of marine species.
- **Coastal Protection**: They help protect shorelines from erosion.
- **Economic Value**: They contribute to tourism, fisheries, and other coastal activities.

## Techniques Explored
The study used controlled experiments to test coral survival under different temperature and sedimentation conditions. Key factors include:
- **Temperature Levels**: 26°C (ambient) and 30°C (elevated).
- **Sedimentation Levels**: 30, 60, 90, 120 mg/cm².
- **Sediment Types**: Natural and anthropogenic.

## Project Outcome
The results showed that both increased temperatures and anthropogenic sedimentation reduce coral survival rates, with elevated temperatures having a more severe impact. Corals in natural sediments fared better than those in anthropogenic sediments, suggesting that human activities like dredging should be managed carefully to mitigate damage to coral reefs.

## Additional Information
The experiments highlighted the importance of managing human activities that contribute to sedimentation, particularly in areas where coral reefs are already stressed by rising temperatures.

## Future Recommendations
- **Further Research**: Conduct experiments with consistent timeframes and explore coral survival over longer durations.
- **Policy Implications**: Consider restricting dredging and other sediment-generating activities to cooler periods of the year when coral resilience is higher.

This project underscores the critical need for targeted conservation efforts to protect coral reefs from the combined threats of climate change and human activity.
